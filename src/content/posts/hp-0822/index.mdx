This is a version of an update I sent out via my email newsletter. If you'd like to follow along, you can sign up <XA href="https://tinyletter.com/prichey">here</XA>.

Hi all,

<XA href="https://vine.co/v/OmMnYLKxIue">It's been</XA> a while! (Only 6 months, but who's counting?)

Recently, I've been doing that thing where I put off writing a newsletter because things keep on happening (<XA href="https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks/status/218439593240956928">so much</XA>, truly) and the compounding effort of covering everything in a single update postpones its completion, ad nauseam.

I'm tired of being ad nauseous. Here are some updates:

In March, I turned 30! To celebrate, I took a few days off and flew to California with my friend Holly. I had been enjoying film photography with my Olympus point-and-shoot but was interested in something a bit higher resolution so I decided to rent a Mamiya 7 and tote it around for the trip. We spent a few days in LA eating as many tacos and fresh fruit cups as possible, then drove out to Palm Springs and Joshua Tree. I had been to LA previously but never to the Mojave, which was incredible: massive and martian. I shot 5 rolls of Portra 400 over as many days and was blown away by the quality of the exposures. I posted a few here, if you're interested: <XA href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/prestonrichey/albums/72177720301476187">https://www.flickr.com/photos/prestonrichey/albums/72177720301476187</XA>.

Aside: the above photo album is on Flickr, and yes, I know it isn't 2007. It's been years since I've actually enjoyed posting on Instagram and in lieu of a better alternative (if you have one, please tell me!) I'm giving Flickr another go. I'm currently in the process of rebuilding my personal website and eventually it might be a good enough alternative that I can homestead 100% but in the meantime, Flickr is good enough for me. Follow me here, if you like!

The itch for large(r) exposure film photography never went away, so in May I pulled the trigger on a 90's Mamiya 645 Pro I had been eyeing on eBay. It's a bit big-boned but features an economical 16 exposures per roll - a nice intermediary between the 36 per roll of a 35mm and the paltry 10 of a 6x7.

After a few rolls of test shots around the neighborhood, I lugged it to Dallas  for <XA href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/prestonrichey/albums/72177720301466680/">a few candid shots</XA> of my niece Rowan, who that weekend was celebrating her 1st birthday (!). I shot Kodak Gold (fitting for the Texan sun, I thought) and Kodak T-max 100. I'm particularly fond of this one of my dad, at Rowan's party.

Over the 4th of July, I visited Maine, again with my friend Holly. This was my first time in New England above Boston so we made a few stops (after a requisite pit stop at <XA href="https://www.row34.com/">Row 34</XA>): first in Salem, MA (couldn't not go to the eponymous witch museum), then in Maine to Portland (incredible lighthouses and clam rolls, terrible parking), New Harbor (<XA href="https://hardyboat.com/cruises/puffin-watch-national-audubon/">the puffin tour!</XA>), and finally Bar Harbor, to Acadia National Park. We did the greatest hits (<XA href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7416166995">Beehive Loop</XA> and Jordan Pond trails, Thunder Hole, <XA href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/prestonrichey/52300953187/in/album-72177720301484893/">Cadillac Mountain sunrise</XA>) and averaged 1.25 lobsters a day over the trip. Again I lugged around the Mamiya, this time with Portra 400 and Ilford HP5 - here are some favorite shots from the trip: <XA href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/prestonrichey/albums/72177720301484893">https://www.flickr.com/photos/prestonrichey/albums/72177720301484893</XA>.

At the end of the July, after more than 4 years of working at <XA href="https://postlight.com/">Postlight</XA>, I decided to leave for new opportunities. I had grown immensely over that time (starting out in Kansas City, later moving to NY, and being promoted to Senior Software Engineer, and then Lead and becoming a manager with 6 reports of my own). I cherished working with the team, but I was ready for different challenges.

I decided to take some time off between roles and hastily threw together plans for a solo trip. I took the opportunity to go somewhere I've wanted to for a long, long time: Iceland. I rented a campervan and did a whole circuit around the ring road with plenty of stops along the way. It was absolutely unreal. The trip demands more than a few sentences here so suffice to say, I'm planning on sharing more. I was there for 10 days and shot 19 rolls of film (ðŸ’¸) so there's absolutely no shortage of material. Expect an upcoming update with more from this trip.

A few days after getting back to the States, I started to feel sick and finally tested positive for COVID. The first few days were rough but I'm already feeling nearly back to 100%, thank goodness.

And that brings us to now (today, in fact!).

Today's my first day joining the team at <XA href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</XA> to work on their collaborative data visualization and exploration platform. I've followed Observable for a while (and <XA href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</XA>, created by Observable co-founder Mike Bostock, for even longer) and am thrilled to help build out the platform. The team is very impressive and I can't wait to get to work.

That's all I've got for now. Thanks for reading along.
(And if not reading, skimming. Skimming is okay too.)

Wishing you all the best,<br />
Preston
