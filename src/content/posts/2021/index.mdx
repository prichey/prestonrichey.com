Hi all. Happy New Year!

It does indeed feel like a happy new year, especially compared to the last. In 2020, still unvaccinated, I stayed in New York over the holidays â€” the first time in my life not being with my family for Thanksgiving or Christmas. In 2021, finally vaxxed (and boosted), I saw my family not once but twice. First, in June, to celebrate the birth of my (first) niece, Rowan, and in December for my first international travel since 2019, to [San Miguel de Allende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_de_Allende), Mexico.

Iâ€™m still working from home most days, but at some point last year the office opened up and Iâ€™ve enjoyed going in and catching up with coworkers every so often. Last year I also spent time in person with friends I hadnâ€™t seen in ages. Things certainly arenâ€™t â€˜back to normalâ€™, but Iâ€™m not sure if theyâ€™ll ever be. Better than last year is good enough for me.

In March, I bought myself a camera Iâ€™d been eyeing for some time - a [Fujifilm X100V](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x100v/). I had wanted something compact enough to carry while traveling, or camping, or just walking around the neighboorhod, but with enough manual controls to [re]learn the basics of photography. As a teenager I loved lugging around my Dadâ€™s hand-me-down Canon AE-1 but ever since my iPhone camera got  â€˜good enoughâ€™, the prospect of paying for (increasingly expensive) film development became unappealing and it started to collect dust.

Sure enough, the X100V is a lot of camera in a tiny package. It has tactile buttons and dials for aperture, shutter speed and more which make experimenting with exposure, composition, and depth of field a joy. It took me some time to figure which of its focus settings I liked the best and how to adjust exposure compensation on a particularly overcast or sunny day. I learned the basics of Lightroom and was blown away by how often I could rescue a photo that out of the camera seemed totally unusable. I started to take pictures I was really proud of.

In 2021, I took lots of pictures but barely shared any. I posted twice to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/preston.richey/) - once to celebrate a year with [my cat Blue](https://www.instagram.com/blue.the.lynxpoint/), and again on [bi visibility day](https://www.instagram.com/p/CULrS4qM5JHH5abyMMS8j7blg3b3jAQT3G9V2A0/) (ðŸ‘‹). Other pictures I shared with friends via text, or with my family via email, but nothing publicly. For years now, neither Instagram, Twitter, nor any other social media platform has felt like a comfortable place to share `content`. I could go on about why thatâ€™s the case (something something ads something something monetized user data something something lack of control) but ultimately none of them feel like the right fit for me. 

Recently Iâ€™ve been thinking again about tools, communication, permanence, and visibility. The phrase â€˜digital homesteadingâ€™ has been bouncing around my head recently. At the moment I donâ€™t have anything to share on that front, but when I do, youâ€™ll be the first to know. ðŸ˜‰

Without further ado, here are some (more) pictures I took with my X100V last year.

## NYC / Hudson / Croton

The beginning of the year was slow. I wasn't vaccinated yet so stayed close to home and practiced with my camera around the neighborhood. In April my friend Holly and I made a quick trip to Hudson to celebrate getting our first shot (though really it mostly an excuse to get the rotisserie chicken at [Kitty's](https://www.kittyshudson.com/)).

Regrettably, I only camped once last year (via bike or otherwise). This time was at Croton Point Park, some 45 miles north of NYC, with my friends James and David. I devised a safety wrist strap to permit taking pictures while riding, but the only keepers of the bunch were once we got to camp.

## Texas

In June I flew for the first time since 2019, to Dallas, to celebrate both the birth of my niece Rowan, and also to celebrate my grandfather's 80th. I didn't take many pictures over the long weekend, but I did get this sunset from I-75. Another highlight of the trip was seeing a [scissor-tailed flycatcher]().

## Los Angeles

I visited LA for the first time over the fourth of July. I went with Holly (a California native) who was an incredible tour guide. We ended up doing a ton but a few of my favorites were:
  * tacos from [El Ruso](https://www.instagram.com/elrusola/)
  * hiking in Malibu / Point Dume
  * the stone fruit plate from [Gjelina](https://gjelina.com/la/)
  * people-watching at Santa Monica Pier

Growing up, I had some inexplicable distate for LA, having never visited â€” probably some teenage Caulfield-esque aversion to a city surely full of 'phonies'. This trip totally changed my mind. I'm already thinking about a return trip, hopefully soon.

## Arizona / Colorado

Later in July, I headed back out west, to visit my sister Brittan, who was in her last year of nursing school in Phoenix. We spent a few days exploring the city before heading
to the Grand Canyon (accurately named, in retrospect). We got up
