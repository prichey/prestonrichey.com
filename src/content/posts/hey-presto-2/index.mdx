<hr />

A few weeks ago I went to a yoga class, my first one in a while. I had forgotten - maybe not intellectually, but physically - how good it feels to stretch deeply. At one point in the class, after a particularly intricate pose, the instructor asked us to take a moment and reflect: were we allowing ourselves to be present, or were we beating ourselves up for not doing the pose perfectly? She asked us, simply, to let the class be a non-precious activity. That idea - an intentional turning-off of the optimization feedback loop and letting an activity exist on its on merit, simply as it is - has stuck with me.

After a bit of reflection, it turns out I very rarely allow myself to be non-precious about anything. I think this is part of what makes me *me*, for better or worse. It also, I think, is what gives me a knack for programming. Always being on the lookout for a way to rework a bit of code to be cleaner or faster is one of the marks of a good developer.

Yet life is not code (at least not unless you believe <XA href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBKRuI2zHp0">Elon Musk</XA>, and not everything needs be tediously optimized. Some things can, and should, exist as they are - simply good enough. So often I struggle to push things out the door because I want them to be as great as I know they can be. (In fact, I mentioned this in my <XA href="https://prestonrichey.com/blog/hey-presto-1/">last newsletter</XA>.) The problem, though, is that you can always do more. Nothing is ever perfect, and most of the time pushing something ever-closer to some hypothetical ideal is a game of chasing diminishing returns.

So what's there to do? I'm still figuring it out, but I think the first step is to cultivate non-preciousness. Ultimately, beating yourself up for not doing a yoga pose 'correctly' will only serve to dissuade yourself from further practice (which, ironically *is* probably going to be the most effective way of actually improving). Is stressing out about the crop or caption on that <XA href="https://www.instagram.com/preston.richey/">Instagram</XA> post - something that likely will garner only a few seconds of attention from your followers - really worth the stress? The answer here, Preston, is no. I just need to try and feel this more intuitively and more often.

Opportunities abound. Going on a run, practicing guitar, or meditating are all activities that are better done than not. Period. They are all things I would like to be better at, and simply showing up and making an effort is the only way to get there. If I were to wait until I can run with perfect form, I would never even lace up my shoes. It would be ridiculous for me to wait to meditate until I can do it perfectly. So why should I not approach everything else the same way? Preciousness has a time and place, but it must be well-reasoned and intentional. Most of the time (for me at least), it isn't.

As with most things, it's a practice. (That's kind of the point!) The common wisdom is that practice makes perfect. While I may disagree with that sentiment, I do feel confident that practice makes better. For most things, that can, and should, be enough.

Hope you're enjoying those flowers as much as I am. üòç
