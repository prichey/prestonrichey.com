Like all great ideas, it started with a tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every morning I wake up and check if Trump is polling higher or lower than the movie Suicide Squad. It’s getting close. <a href="https://t.co/f9O9NcuUPz">pic.twitter.com/f9O9NcuUPz</a></p>&mdash; PJ Vogt (@PJVogt) <a href="https://twitter.com/PJVogt/status/895824447113842689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

In an era where everything is rated, from movies to restaurants to <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-fidget-spinners/" target="_blank">fidget spinners</a>, there was something really amusing about comparing apples and oranges, as it were: this brunch spot is about as popular as that pair of headphones; this album is about as popular as that Airbnb host, etc. So, I set out to find a movie that is doing about as well as the president.

## So many APIs

First, I had to figure out how well the president is actually doing. Picking a single one from the tens (maybe hundreds) of different polls, indexes, and surveys turned out to be an impossible task, so I chose the calculations of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a>, which seem to be <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-were-tracking-donald-trumps-approval-ratings/" target="_blank">well reasoned</a> and attempt to account for all other major polls, with each of those scores weighted based on <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/" target="_blank">historical accuracy</a>. FiveThirtyEight also updates their rating multiple times a day, which allows for more varied results, which in turn make for a more interesting web experience (since if you check the page at multiple times of the day, the results might differ).

Next, I tackled the problem of building up a database of movies with their corresponding <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> ratings. The only problem is, there isn't a publicly accessible API for this information. There is a <a href="https://developer.fandango.com/Rotten_Tomatoes" target="_blank">private API</a> which developers can apply to access (and I did), but almost 4 months after submitting the application, I still haven't heard anything back. With further googling, I found two API's that I combined to do the job: <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank">The Movie DB</a>, which offers a free <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api" target="_blank">API</a> with a `/discover` endpoint that yields lists of popular movies, but *doesn't* include the RT rating, and <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/" target="_blank">The Open Movie Database</a> (OMDb), which doesn't provide any sort of `/discover` feature, but *does* include the RT rating for specific movies.

While FiveThirtyEight gives a rating to the tenth (e.g. 38.7%), RT deals in integers, so I knew I'd have to gather enough movies to cover each possible rating, 0% - 100. (In reality, there's never going to be anywhere near total consensus, so it's unlikely that some movies will be used, but hey, with this President you never know.) I also wanted to have enough for each rating that the results were varied, and you could come back to the site and get different results each time. I ended up building a <a href="https://github.com/prichey/rottentrumpatoes/blob/master/movies.json" target="_blank">database</a> of over 1,800 movies, each with a title, year, RT rating, number of IMDB ratings, and poster image. I ignore movies from this year, since their rating may not be stable yet. Then, for each rating, I select the 20 movies with the most ratings on IMDB (even if a movie is 'bad', movies with the most reviews are more likely to be recognizable), and provide one at random that matches the president's current rating (which is updated every hour).

## Dev niceties

While not publicly accessible, I created a way to manage movies in the DB which allowed me to remove movies from consideration, as well as merely to examine the huge list of movies I created. I decided to remove some movies from the DB that were either unknown, in poor taste, or just weren't funny. Since my database was a huge JSON file, it was nearly impossible to view in a text editor, but viewing the top results via this interface turned out to be very useful.

</div>

I also made an interface for scraping, which allows you to specify the specific pages of the TMDb `/discover` endpoint to scrape (useful if the app crashes, which of course it never did). Using `socket.io` I streamed the server results in realtime to the client, so that you can follow along and see progress as the scraper runs, which is helpful as I let it run over the course of 10+ hours.

I learned a lot working on this project. I combined several disparate API's (at least 4, by my count), as well as brushed up my scraping skills (most of it done with Google's newish <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer" target="_blank">Puppeteer</a>, which turned out to be a blast to use). After more than a month of working evenings and weekends, I launched the site (via tweet, of course), which, to my surprise, was retweeted by PJ, the originator of the initial idea.
